I've tried so many IDEs during my career as coder, from Visual Studio (microsoft),
 [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/),
 [atom](https://atom.io/), [sublime text][]


## Sublime text

* Install the [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/), **This should be the only package you have to install manually**
* ``Ctrl-Shift-P`` to access the Package Control
* My [sublime text setting](./Preferences.sublime-settings.json)

### Packages

* [python 3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%203)

### References

* [Setting up sublimetext for python](https://dbader.org/blog/setting-up-sublime-text-for-python-development)
